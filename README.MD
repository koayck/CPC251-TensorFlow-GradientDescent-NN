# Neural Network Weight Estimation using Gradient Descent

Welcome to the Neural Network Weight Estimation project! In this repository, we implement the gradient descent algorithm to estimate the weights of a neural network model from scratch.

## Introduction
Neural networks play a crucial role in machine learning and deep learning. Understanding how neural network weights are estimated is fundamental for building robust models. In this project, we explore the gradient descent optimization technique to find optimal weights for our neural network.
